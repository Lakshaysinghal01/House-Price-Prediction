 üìñ Overview
The **House Price Prediction App** is a web-based application that predicts house prices in Bangalore based on key parameters such as location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHKs (Bedrooms, Hall, Kitchen)
. Built using **Streamlit**, the app leverages a pre-trained **Ridge Regression model** to provide accurate and user-friendly predictions.

This project can assist buyers, real estate agents, and developers in estimating property prices efficiently.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

**1. Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/Lakshaysinghal01/House-Price-Prediction.git
 
 cd house-price-prediction.

Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not present, manually install these libraries:

pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn

Run the Application

Running the Project
1.	Start the Application: Navigate to the project directory and run:
streamlit run app.py

2.	Access the Web Interface: After running the above command, Streamlit will launch a local web server, and a browser tab will open automatically. If it doesn't, open the URL displayed in your terminal, typically http://localhost:8501.


3.	Navigation:

o	Home: An introduction to the app.

o	Predict Price:

ÔÇß	Select a location from the dropdown (populated from Cleaned_data.csv).

ÔÇß	Input total square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of BHKs.

ÔÇß	Click "Predict" to view the predicted price in lakhs.

o	About: Learn more about the app and its purpose.
________________________________________
Key Notes

‚Ä¢	Model Loading: The Ridge Regression model (RidgeModel.pkl) is loaded using pickle. Ensure this file is not corrupted or missing.

‚Ä¢	CSV Data: The Cleaned_data.csv file provides unique location options. If you want to update the locations, modify this file accordingly.

‚Ä¢	Streamlit Port: By default, Streamlit runs on port 8501. Use --server.port <port_number> if you want to run it on a different port.
________________________________________
Troubleshooting
1.	Module Not Found: Ensure all libraries are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt, where requirements.txt includes:
   
streamlit

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

3.	File Not Found:

o	Ensure Cleaned_data.csv and RidgeModel.pkl are in the same directory as app.py.

o	If your terminal path differs, navigate to the correct folder before running streamlit.

4.	Model Issues: If the model raises errors, confirm that RidgeModel.pkl matches the input features specified in app.py.

üõ† How to Use

1.	Home Page: Provides an introduction to the app and its purpose.

2.	Predict Price:

o	Select a location from the dropdown menu.

o	Input the total square footage of the property.

o	Specify the number of bathrooms and BHKs.

o	Click on the Predict button to view the predicted price.

3.	About Page: Displays details about the app and its features.

üìä Input Parameters

The app accepts the following inputs:

‚Ä¢	Location: A dropdown list of predefined locations from Cleaned_data.csv.

‚Ä¢	Total Sqft: Total square footage of the property (range: 300 to 10,000 sqft).

‚Ä¢	Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms (range: 1 to 10).

‚Ä¢	BHK: Number of bedrooms, halls, and kitchens (range: 1 to 10).
________________________________________
üß† Machine Learning Model

The app uses a Ridge Regression model trained on historical house price data from Bangalore.
Why Ridge Regression?

‚Ä¢	Handles multicollinearity effectively.

‚Ä¢	Reduces overfitting by applying L2 regularization.

‚Ä¢	Provides better generalization for unseen data.

The model was serialized using pickle and is loaded at runtime to make predictions.
